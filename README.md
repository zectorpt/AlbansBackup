##Welcome to Albans Backup System!

***UNDER DEV***

Q: How to set my download folders and other configurations?
A: All configurations are part of the albansbackup.sh file. You just need to set the values as you want. If you want to test it without changes. Perfect! Variables that need to be changed are DIRTOBACKUP, BACKUPDESTINATION and DIRTORESTORE
