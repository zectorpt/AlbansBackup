#Welcome to Albans Backup System!

ABS was develop for Ocado Technology and is free to use, available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution.

With ABS you can backup a selected folder using a snapshot file, instead of create multiple backup files. You will have an easy backup menu to use that will help you backup, restore and configure.


Q: How to set my download folders and other configurations?
A: All configurations are part of the albansbackup.sh file. You just need to set the values as you want. If you want to test it without changes. Perfect! Variables that need to be changed are DIRTOBACKUP, BACKUPDESTINATION and DIRTORESTORE
